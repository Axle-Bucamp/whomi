# WHOIM V2 Enhanced Documentation

## Overview
WHOIM V2 is a decentralized identity proof platform that allows users to create and manage multiple personas, verify their identity across different platforms, and maintain privacy through blockchain-based verification.

## New Features and Enhancements

### 1. Smart Contract Functionality
- **Blockchain-based Identity Verification**: Implemented a comprehensive Solidity smart contract (WHOIMIdentityProof.sol) for secure identity verification
- **Zero-Cost Read Operations**: All verification and proof retrieval operations are implemented as view functions, ensuring no gas costs for reading data
- **Cross-Platform Verification**: Smart contract supports verification of the same identity across different platforms

### 2. Public/Private Persona Control
- **Visibility Toggle**: Added checkbox options to control whether personas are publicly visible or private
- **Granular Privacy Control**: Users can make individual personas public while keeping others private
- **Visibility Management**: Existing personas can have their visibility changed at any time

### 3. Cross-Platform Verification System
- **Verification Interface**: Added dedicated verification page with two verification methods:
  - Direct verification using proof ID, public key, and platform ID
  - Cross-platform verification with verification code generation
- **Verification Code**: Generates a unique code that can be used to verify the same persona across different platforms
- **User-Friendly Results**: Clear success/failure indicators with detailed information about the verification

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **Fixed 404 Error**: Added proper not-found page to handle 404 errors gracefully
- **Enhanced Security**: All private keys are stored locally in encrypted format
- **Improved UI**: Added toggles and verification interfaces for better user experience

## Architecture

### Smart Contract
The WHOIMIdentityProof smart contract provides the following functions:
- `createProof`: Creates a new identity proof on the blockchain
- `updateProofVisibility`: Updates the visibility of an existing proof
- `getProof`: Retrieves proof details (zero-cost read operation)
- `verifyProof`: Verifies if a proof exists and matches provided data (zero-cost read operation)
- `getUserProofs`: Gets all proofs for a user (zero-cost read operation)
- `isProofPublic`: Checks if a proof is public (zero-cost read operation)

### Frontend Components
- **PersonaCard**: Displays persona information with visibility toggle
- **CreatePersonaForm**: Form for creating new personas with public/private option
- **VerifyPersonaForm**: Basic verification form for direct verification
- **CrossPlatformVerifier**: Advanced verification with code generation for cross-platform verification

### Data Flow
1. User creates a persona, optionally making it public
2. The persona is stored locally with encrypted private keys
3. A proof is created on the blockchain with the specified visibility
4. Other users can verify the persona across platforms if it's public
5. The owner can change visibility settings at any time

## User Guide

### Managing Personas
1. Navigate to the Personas page
2. Create a new persona using the "Create New Persona" button
3. Toggle the "Make this persona publicly visible" checkbox to control visibility
4. For existing personas, use the toggle switch to change visibility

### Verifying Identity Across Platforms
1. Navigate to the Verify page
2. Choose between "Cross-Platform Verification" or "Direct Verification"
3. For Cross-Platform Verification:
   - Enter the Proof ID and Platform ID
   - If verification is successful, you'll receive a verification code
   - Ask the persona to provide this code to confirm their identity
4. For Direct Verification:
   - Enter the Proof ID, Public Key, and Platform ID
   - The system will verify if they match

## Security Considerations
- All private keys are stored locally in encrypted format
- Smart contract operations that modify data require transaction signing
- Read operations are zero-cost and don't require gas fees
- Public personas are visible to anyone, so users should be careful about what information they make public

## Access Instructions
